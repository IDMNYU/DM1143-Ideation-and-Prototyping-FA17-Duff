# Creative Process Annotated Bibliography & Video Documentary

Working in groups of two, you will research, analyze, evaluate, and communicate the research & design processes of a creator from a discipline of your team’s choice. The final form of this research project will be an annotated bibliography and video documentary of 1 to 3 minutes in length.

The key to your research is a proliferation of references on your subject, particularly interviews, sketchbooks, notebooks, and/or journals or other reflective writing which can give your team insights into the research and design processes of your subject.

### Annotated Bibliography

You will write an annotated bibliography as a team. I recommend using google docs to collaboratively write. The bare minimum of sources is five.

Using [Purdue OWL Annotated Bibliography Guidelines](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/614/01/), summarize, assess, and reflect.

* The Wikipedia Disclaimer: Nowadays, wikipedia is often the starting point for research – it’s quick, easy, and provides an acceptable overview of many subjects. However, for serious, sustained research Wikipedia should not be relied upon as a primary source. Use Wikipedia to familiarize yourself with your subject and to locate other sources for further research.

### Creative Process Video Documentary

Create a video documenting the creative process of your chosen creator. This is not a “documentary” in the traditional sense, this is a video that both documents your chosen creator’s process, and is also an experimental video work in and of itself. This is not about telling the story of how they came to be an artist, designer, or creative technologist; this is about your team telling the story of their process, without a linear narrative.

Your team’s video documentary must be 1 to 3 minutes long and be executed with the utmost care and craftsmanship. Carefully consider such filmic aspects as editing, montage, visual rhythm, supplemental graphics and titles, audio score, storytelling, tone, and point of view

The process documentary will reveal:

* the discoveries your team made about your subject, and, more specifically how these discoveries will inform or have informed both of your own creative processes, etc.
